I mostly use github as an instant messaging platform. And issue tracking from time to time. Now it also hosts my new blog. And I even got my first own repository. ha! What about that.

<h3>To do:</h3>
<ul><li>Figure out how not to type in username-pw each time I write something</li>
<li>How can I use gedit for example and commit posts with just one shortcut?</li>
</ul>
